			<h1>About me</h1>
			<p>	When I was a child, I used to read books voraciously.
				I would read page after page and obsess over faraway lands.
				Only when I started traveling did I realize what the travel
				quote “it’s better to see something once than hear about it
				a thousand times.”
			</p>

			<p><strong>As a travel writer,</strong> I try my hardest to
				describe places and destinations of my readers. However,
				there are just some things and experiences that are too
				beautiful to put down in words.
